This software is released under GPLv3 licence.

## What is good

- pretty command line interface with interactive mode

- geographic amenity search using OSM

- extra feature: recursive website text extraction   


## What is bad or still needs to be improved

- Instructions for Windows and macOS: installation, run and test 

- Rather slow, currently hardly any async or parallelization

- Redundancy in file system: currently optimized for rerunning smaller parts of the application, tradeoff is that overall memory is inefficiently used

- Still a lot of warnings are printed but seems to work anyway

- Only tested for Germany
